Running this code requires you to download and install the Developer's Edition of the Adobe ColdFusion web application server from http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/

Once you have setup the server, place the sample files in the webroot. You should then be able to access individual chapter examples like so:

http://127.0.0.1/Chapter_12/
http://127.0.0.1/Chapter_13/
http://127.0.0.1/Chapter_14/
